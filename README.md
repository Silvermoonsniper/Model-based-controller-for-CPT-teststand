# Model Control analysis and Simulation demo for Vibro Crawler
A novel proposed model-based controller mechanism is used to control penetration movement of CPT cone, which is applied in the Geotechnical field test.

This is a testing framework which can be applied to controller model and real CPT experiment data.

Simulation Example:
